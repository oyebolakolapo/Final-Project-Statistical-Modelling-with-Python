# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
1.API connection and data extraction/cleaning in Python
-Citybikes
-Foursquare
2.Yelp
3.Joining datasets in Python
SQL in Python
Model building

## Process
1. Connected to Citybikes, Foursquare and Yelp APIs (selected city was Barcelona)
2. Joined Foursquare and Yelp datasets
3. Modelled the relationship between number of bikes at each bike station in Barcelona with points of interest such as distance to bars or food joints, popularity and rating.

## Results
1. Similar number of bike stations were identified with Foursquare and Yelp APIs\
2. Points of interest correlated with the number of available bikes at each station in Barcelona

## Challenges 
Ran out of Yelp API key

## Future Goals
-Spend more time on transforming datasets 
-Attempt different data visualization methods
-Use this modeling approach for my current dataset
