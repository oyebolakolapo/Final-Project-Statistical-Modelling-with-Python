# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
1.API connection and data extraction/cleaning in Python
-Citybikes
-Foursquare
2.Yelp
3.Joining datasets in Python
SQL in Python
Model building

## Process
1. Connected to Citybikes, Foursquare and Yelp APIs (selected city was Barcelona)
2. Joined Foursquare and Yelp datasets
3. Modelled the relationship between number of bikes at each bike station in Barcelona with points of interest such as distance to bars or food joints, popularity and rating.

## Results
1. Similar number of bike stations were identified with Foursquare and Yelp APIs\
2. Overall, the model suggests that the characteristics of the points of interest(e.g.popularity and rating of bars and restaurants) do not have a strong correlation with the estimated number of bikes available at a given bike station. However, it does appear that at bike stations within short average distances from highly rated and popular bars/restaurants, more bikes are available at the station. On the other hand, with lower rated bars/restaurants around, fewer bikes are available at the bike station.

## Challenges 
Ran out of Yelp API key

## Future Goals
-Spend more time on transforming datasets 
-Attempt different data visualization methods
-Use this modeling approach for my current dataset
